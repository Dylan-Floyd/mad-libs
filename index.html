            The Road Not Taken
            BY ROBERT FROST
            ​
            <p>Two <span id="word1" class="libs">roads</span> diverged in a <span id="word2" class="libs">yellow</span>
                wood,
                And sorry I could not <span id="word3" class="libs">travel</span> both
                And be one <span id="word4" class="libs">traveler</span>, long I <span id="word5"
                    class="libs">stood</span>
                And looked down one as far as I could
                To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
            ​
            <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,
                And having perhaps the better claim,
                Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
                Though as for that the passing there
                Had worn them really about the same,</p>
            ​
            <p>And both that morning equally lay
                In leaves no step had trodden black.
                Oh, I kept the first for another day!
                Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
                I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
            ​
            <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh
                Somewhere ages and ages hence:
                Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
                I took the one less traveled by,
                And that has made all the difference.</p>
